# equalizerInMatlab
 This is a class project made in MATLAB, to simulate and filter .wav files and see their playback behavior in real time, showing their frequency spectrum.
  
 Wav files can be loaded from MATLAB, the sample rate must be 44100 [Hz].
 See the frequency response of the filters designed in MATLAB (filter Design), these are in the "Filters" folder and using the .mat files they can be modified.
 Play the audio for about a min or the duration of the audio.
 Observe the frequency response of the filters using the checkBox.
 Observe in real time the frequency response of filtered audio or original audio using a checkBox.
 Friendly user interface in Spanish (it's my native language).
